# Personal Website

## Things to improve on:
* Header: nav-links don't have them so close to the top (make them lower in general)
* get rid of the scroll in the main header welcome page (done)
* The move the cloud by pixels and not by vh (because will overlap on larger devices) (done)
* back to top shouldn't be present if content fits into the window
* check on different devices/ browsers

* scale 3.5 for the big image but not for the small image when on load
