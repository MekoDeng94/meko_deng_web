# 7 1/2 month Internship Experience at Nuance as software QA tester
As Nuance was my first internship in a corporate environment, I wanted to document the whole experience and provide some insight to fellow students who might be wondering what it's like to work a 'typical' 9 to 5 job. I'll talk about which knowledges I had prior to starting the internship, the different positions/ projects I was able to work on and finally, the amazing team I was blessed to work with.

And just for safety, the following 'blog' was approved by my direct supervisor and breaches no non-disclosure agreements.

## Some Context
I started my internship on the second half of my 3rd year at university for the winter semester - I had taken off a semester to do an internship. Prior to this internship, I had occupied a 4 month summer position in 2016 in a research lab at another university doing mostly automation. All this to say that I did not know what to expect at all in a QA/ software position.

The two reasons why I decided to take an internship was  1) I honestly just wanted to take a break from school and 2) I felt the need to experience a 9 to 5 job, otherwise known as the 'boring life' as we millenials call it. University is stressful, especially having an engineering major can be soul crushing when you're not 'passionate' about what you learn. Midway through my 3rd year at university, I started having doubts about finishing school, I needed a breath of fresh air to get myself back on track so I thought why not do an internship. Then I thought I should try to get a typical full time job. I had always told myself that I wouldn't want to occupy a position that would require me to stay in a cubicle all day, but I believe in giving everyhing a shot before judging. 

And with my mind made up, there I was, on my merry way to internship hunting.

## Prior knowledge to the Internship
When I applied to the position of 'software QA tester', I knew absolutely nothing about anything. I had done a basic java course and played around with some C++ at my previous internship, but I had 0 knowedge for anything other than that in the software domain. Let's just say it was a stroke of luck that I was given the opportunity to work at Nuance.

## Movement within my QA position/ and different projects worked on
During the first 2 months of the internship, I was doing QA work - not the kind where I would write unit tests or antyhing - but the kind that was more specificaly taylored to the team. Then, my journey began as I joined the 'senior intern' in the internal tools team within my QA team. 

I was initially given the choice to work either with one supervisor that was going on paternity leave on a tool which I would propose or work with another supervisor that already had a project in mind. I chose the later (I eventually did do some personal project proposals but I was too ambitious with the time I had and wasn't able to follow through the project)

(insert some kind of time table showing what/when I worked on different projects)

The project I ended up working on for the majority of the rest of my internship was essentially a web app to faciliate/ secure certain processes in the tools team. Initially, I was tasked to design the front end of the web app. As such, within a couple of weeks (~4-8 weeks) I had to learn javascript/html/css and how to use Vuejs + webpack. When I started the project, I had no idea what 'front end' or 'framework' meant and within a couple of exhausting weeks of working 9 to 5 plus voluntary overtime at home, I was able to grasp the jist of it. Then, I was tasked to maintain the backend (Python, flask, SQL) as the previous intern had left, which was a lot easier to learn as it was already set up.

Around 1 1/2 - 2 months into the project, the base was pretty much set up. For the rest of my internship, I was implementing new features, going through team feedbacks on how to improve the tool, code reviews and setting up/ writing some unit tests for the frontend (Jest) and backend (pytest + pytest-bdd). The final tool looked a little like this:

## How I would ave done it differently/ some ressources used
The way I learned how to develop a way app was a mess. I started by learning the framework, then looking into what the hell HTML/CSS was and finally slowly understand how to work with javascript. If I was to suggest anyone wanting to learn web development now, I would suggest usind freecodecamp.com and go through all the courses there. it would provide a good base on what web development is and how everthing ties up together. Other ressources:

## The people
As cliche as it might sound, it really is the people that make the experience. I was fortunate to have an attentive supervisor to guide me along the way - giving me readings, suggesting how to approach a certain problem, hold weekly one on one meetings to check up on how I was doing - just to name a few. I was also surrounded by experts in the field on the tools team that were always willing to help and provided constructive criticism/ suggestions and ressources to problems that I was facing. They were honestly such an amazing team and I couldn't ask for any more than that.

Besides the direct tools team I was working with, there were all the other people in the QA team I genuinely enjoyed hanging out with. There is this group of guys that would, without a fault, go drink every friday and they would ask me to join every week even though I said I couldn't the majority of the time. There is the paternity leaved supervisor with whom I was very comfortable talking to freely. There is one person in the QA team I spent a lot of time with outside of work bouldering and playing volleyball. There is my initial QA mentor with whom I could practice my japanese with and talk about little things here and there (she is the sweetest) and there were other people in the office with whom I would play foosball on breaks or eat lunch with.

Not to mention all the other interns! The 3 interns I shared a room with that got me into investing in crypto and learning a lot about different techs, asking for advice on personal projects and talk about really really dumb stuff at some times. All the other interns with whom I would also go bouldering with after work, or share a drink from time to time.

And of course, not forgetting my manager, who I find is sometimes scary when he is serious but a very kind person that gave me the opportunity to work with the team.

I was able to create such great memories with all of them, and I know for a fact that without them, this internship wouldn't have been the same at all and to them, I owe a huge THANK YOU <3

## Concluding thoughts
This was my experience doing a QA internship at Nuance, not all internships are going to be the same, each experience is unique. The team and the people really make the difference and can shape up the whole experience.

That steep learning curve was a challenge, and I loved it. I loved knowing that I knew absolutely nothing about a topic and I loved learning. That was defintiely a huge 'eureka' moment for me, that's when I understood that I am someone that constantly needs to be learning something new, keep my mind stimulated, and that is exactly why I find coding/ software development so fulfilling.

In summary the different technical skills I learned through this experience are as follow:

* Frontend:
* * Vuejs
* * HTML/CSS/Javascript
* * Jest

* Backend:
* * Python
* * Flask
* * MySQL DB
* * Pytest + Pytest BDD

What's next?
Docker, CSS more in depth, MongoDB(NoSQL), Angular/React

Can't wait to see how the next intern is going to revamp it!
I can finally go to a hackathon and know that I can come up with something :')

A 9 to 5 job might actually not be so bad after all. If there is one thing I learned besides some coding during this internship, it's that your attitude will determine your experience: you can of course, complain about how it's terrible staying stuck at the same place all day (which, I'm not going to lie, did happen a lot to me), but you can also chose to focus on things that you enjoy and let the experience shape around that. 

Happy internshiping!
