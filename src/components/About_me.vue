        <h1>Hi there! I'm Meko</h1>
        <h2>I consider myself a passionate illustrator, avid developer and occasional storyteller</h2>
        My main focus is on the process of learning and growth.
        <!-- My goal is to inspire others to learn and grow through sharing -->

        <h2> Coding </h2>
        My journey to the path of becoming a developer started with web development through a memorable internship
        experience. Though I am still in the early stages of this journey, everyday, I am driven to learn more and improve on
        areas where I'm lacking.

        <h2> Illustrating </h2>
        Art runs through my veins, illustrating helps me express myself and share bits and part of me with all of you.

        free to contact me!

        All illustrations/ animations on this website was designed by me. I used VueJs, HTML, CSS, ButterCMS and SVG to create
        the website. If you notice any weird behaviors, please let me know!
